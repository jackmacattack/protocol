(Invitation found in Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral)

To the honorable Dr. Dylan Small,

It is my pleasure to extend to you this invitation to join myself and other intelligent citizens who can no longer bear to live under the strain and constant danger of The Commune. I have labored in secret to create the last, best hope for humanity’s survival, a spaceship capable of transporting a population of men and women to the nearest habitable planet. Earth is dying. If The Commune is right in one thing, it is that we killed our home. But I am here to give you this opportunity to do more than just survive. I want to rebuild, to return to the glory of what once was, and I believe you do as well. And that is why I need you, Dr. Small. Your work in robotic technologies revolutionized the way the world functioned. Would you see all your hard work come to naught?

Sincerely,
Leandra King
