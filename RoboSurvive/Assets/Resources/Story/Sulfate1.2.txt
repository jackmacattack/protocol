(Recovered email)

Mom,
	
I just wanted to email you and let you know that I’m alright, the fires aren’t in my part of the state. Ever since the sky turned white, it hasn’t rained once here, and I’m starting to get scared. It seems like it’s this way everywhere. What about the crops? What about drinking water? I don’t know mom, I just hope everything is alright.

Love,
Jane
