(Pamphlet found on the streets of Wichita)

When your government failed you, turned the sky white and killed the world, who gave you water? 

THE COMMUNE

When your government tried to take that water away, who stood up for you? 

THE COMMUNE

When the wealthy and powerful took everything they could find and left us to die, who found them and brought it all back to you? 

THE COMMUNE

Brothers and sisters, join today! Together we can finish off the corrupt fiend that calls itself the American government! Our control extends from California to Georgia and the enemy is about to fall! Let’s take up arms for our own fate, for our own freedom! 

LONG LIVE THE COMMUNE
