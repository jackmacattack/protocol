(Note found in abandoned home)

Dear Mary,

I want you to know that I love you, and that I love Jack. He’s going to grow up and be just as perfect as you are. But I won’t be there to see that. The Commune, they’ve started rounding up all the scientists and people with money, throwing them God knows where, and eventually they’re going to find out who I was. Unless I’m already gone. So I need you to do one last thing for me. I need you to give my body to The Commune. That way, you and Jack will be safe. I’m sorry. 

Love forever,
Brian
